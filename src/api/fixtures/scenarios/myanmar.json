  "reasoning_summary": "The forecast is shaped by the unprecedented military success of the Three Brotherhood Alliance since Operation 1027 (Oct 2023), which has fundamentally altered the power balance in northern Myanmar. TKG embeddings show Tatmadaw capability vectors declining at a rate consistent with historical garrison-collapse patterns, while resistance force coordination embeddings are in the strongest cluster ever observed. The primary countervailing factor is Chinese diplomatic leverage — Beijing enforced a ceasefire in January 2024 and retains the ability to constrain alliance operations through supply chain and border crossing control. The moderate confidence (0.58) reflects genuine uncertainty about whether China will allow a capital capture or intervene to prevent it.",
