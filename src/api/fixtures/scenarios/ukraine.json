Ukraine's territorial integrity demands and Russia's insistence on recognizing annexed territories create an impasse that increased diplomatic contact alone cannot bridge. The TKG model's embedding analysis shows the relationship trajectory moving toward historical negotiation-precursor patterns, but at a pace too slow to produce formal talks within 90 days absent a forcing function. The LLM weights this higher than the TKG (0.31 vs 0.22) because it can reason about the qualitative shifts in US and Chinese diplomatic language that the structural model misses.",
