# TKG Retraining Configuration
#
# Schedule settings for periodic model retraining to keep the TKG predictor
# current with evolving world events. Uses time-based scheduling (weekly/monthly)
# rather than performance-triggered retraining for simplicity and consistency.

schedule:
  # Retraining frequency: "weekly" or "monthly"
  frequency: weekly

  # For weekly: day of week (0=Sunday, 1=Monday, ..., 6=Saturday)
  day_of_week: 0

  # For monthly: day of month (1-28 recommended for consistency)
  day_of_month: 1

  # Hour to run retraining (24-hour format, in local time)
  # 2 AM recommended to minimize impact on system usage
  hour: 2

data:
  # Number of days of GDELT data to use for retraining
  # 30 days provides sufficient recent patterns without excessive data
  data_window: 30

  # Maximum events to sample (0 = unlimited)
  # Use 500000-1000000 for reasonable training time on CPU
  max_events: 1000000

model:
  # Training hyperparameters (matched to original training)
  epochs: 50
  batch_size: 1024
  embedding_dim: 200
  num_layers: 2
  learning_rate: 0.001

versioning:
  # Number of old model versions to keep for rollback
  backup_count: 3

  # Model directory path
  model_dir: models/tkg

  # Log directory path
  log_dir: logs/retraining

validation:
  # Minimum MRR improvement required to replace current model
  # Set to 0 to always accept new model regardless of performance
  min_improvement: 0.0

  # Number of validation samples for comparison
  validation_samples: 1000
