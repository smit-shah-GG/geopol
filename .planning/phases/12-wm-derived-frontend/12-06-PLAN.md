<objective>
Build the Country Brief Page: a full-screen tabbed modal that opens when a country is clicked on the globe. Contains 6 tabs: Overview, Active Forecasts, GDELT Events, Forecast History, Entity Relations, and Calibration. This is the deepest data exploration surface in the dashboard.

Purpose: FE-06 -- the country-specific drill-down. Users click a country on the globe and see everything the system knows about it: active forecasts, event history, entity relationships, and calibration quality.

Output: CountryBriefPage component with 6 tabs, each rendering data from the API.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: CountryBriefPage modal with Overview + Active Forecasts + GDELT Events tabs</name>
  <files>frontend/src/components/CountryBriefPage.ts</files>
  <action>
    Create CountryBriefPage (~400-500 lines). Read WM's CountryBriefPage.ts (677 lines) for the tab structure pattern, but build new content. This is a standalone modal, not a Panel subclass.

    **Modal structure (from WM pattern):**
    - Full-screen overlay (same as ScenarioExplorer): dark backdrop, modal inset 20px
    - Header: country flag emoji + country name + ISO code + risk score badge + close button
    - Tab bar: horizontal tabs below header
    - Tab content area: fills remaining space, scrollable
    - Close on: Escape, backdrop click, X button

    **Tab system:**
    - Private `activeTab: string` state
    - Tab bar rendered with h(): buttons for each tab, active tab gets `tab-active` class
    - Clicking tab calls `switchTab(tabId)` which re-renders tab content
    - Tabs: 'overview' | 'forecasts' | 'events' | 'history' | 'entities' | 'calibration'

    **Data loading:**
    - On open(iso): call `forecastClient.getForecastsByCountry(iso)` and `forecastClient.getCountryRisk(iso)`
    - Store results: `this.forecasts: ForecastResponse[]`, `this.countryRisk: CountryRiskSummary | null`
    - Show loading state while fetching, error state on failure

    **Tab 1 - Overview (default tab):**
    Dashboard-within-a-dashboard layout. Grid of 4 summary cards:
    1. **Risk Score card**: Large number (0-100), color-coded, trend arrow, "last 7 days" label
    2. **Top Forecast card**: Question text, probability bar, confidence badge
    3. **Recent Events card**: placeholder with "GDELT event feed" text and count (mock data for now)
    4. **Calibration Snapshot card**: Brier score value, historical accuracy percentage
    - Each card: surface-hover bg, padding, border-radius
    - This gives an at-a-glance view before drilling into tabs

    **Tab 2 - Active Forecasts:**
    - List of all forecasts for this country (from getForecastsByCountry)
    - Each forecast rendered as an expanded card (more detail than ForecastPanel's compact rows):
      - Full question text
      - Probability bar (full width, labeled)
      - Confidence level badge
      - Scenario count
      - Ensemble breakdown inline (LLM: X% | TKG: Y%)
      - Created/expires timestamps
    - Each card is clickable: dispatches `forecast-selected` event (opens ScenarioExplorer)
    - If no forecasts: "No active forecasts for this country"

    **Tab 3 - GDELT Events:**
    - Placeholder for now (no raw events endpoint exists)
    - Show: "GDELT event data will be available when the ingest daemon is running."
    - Render 5-6 mock event rows demonstrating the layout:
      - Timestamp | Actor1 -> Action -> Actor2 | CAMEO code badge | Goldstein scale bar
    - Ready for real data when an events endpoint is added

    Continue implementing remaining 3 tabs in the SAME file -- this is one component.

    **Tab 4 - Forecast History:**
    - Line chart showing probability evolution over time (SVG, hand-rolled or d3-shape):
      - X-axis: dates, Y-axis: probability (0-1)
      - One line per forecast question
      - Dots at data points, hover for tooltip
    - Below the chart: scrollable list of past forecasts (same card format as Active Forecasts tab)
    - For now with mock data: show placeholder "History populates as forecasts accumulate"
    - If forecasts exist, plot their probability values as single points (one-time snapshots rather than evolution lines)

    **Tab 5 - Entity Relations:**
    - Toggle button: "Graph View" | "Table View"
    - **Graph View** (default): d3-force simulation
      - Extract entities from all forecasts for this country: collect all `scenario.entities` across all scenarios
      - Build edges: two entities appearing in the same scenario = one edge, weight = scenario.probability
      - Render with d3.forceSimulation():
        - Nodes: entity names as labels, sized by frequency
        - Links: lines connecting co-occurring entities, width proportional to weight
        - Force: center, charge (repel), link (attract connected)
        - SVG container: responsive width, ~400px height
        - Nodes draggable (d3.drag)
      - If no entities: "Entity relationships populate from forecast scenarios"
    - **Table View**: Simple table with columns: Entity | Co-occurs With | Frequency | Avg Probability
      - One row per entity pair
      - Sorted by frequency descending

    **Tab 6 - Calibration:**
    - Reuse the reliability diagram rendering pattern from CalibrationPanel (Plan 04)
    - Show per-country calibration data (from forecast.calibration fields)
    - Reliability diagram: predicted vs observed (same SVG rendering as CalibrationPanel)
    - Brier score decomposition table: Reliability | Resolution | Uncertainty (if data available)
    - Per-CAMEO category accuracy table: Category | Accuracy | Sample Size
    - If no calibration data: "Calibration data populates as predictions resolve"

    **Event handling:**
    - Listen for `country-selected` CustomEvent on window:
      ```typescript
      window.addEventListener('country-selected', (e) => {
        const iso = (e as CustomEvent<{ iso: string }>).detail.iso;
        this.open(iso);
      });
      ```
    - Public `open(iso: string)`: show modal, fetch data, render overview tab
    - Public `close()`: hide modal
    - Public `destroy()`: cleanup

    **CSS (add to panels.css):**
    - `.country-brief-backdrop`: same as scenario explorer
    - `.country-brief-modal`: fixed inset 20px, flex column
    - `.country-brief-header`: country flag, name, risk badge, close btn
    - `.country-brief-tabs`: horizontal tab bar, uppercase labels
    - `.tab-button`: padding, monospace, border-bottom active indicator
    - `.tab-content`: flex 1, overflow-y auto, padding
    - `.overview-grid`: CSS grid 2x2 for summary cards
    - `.overview-card`: surface-hover bg, padding, border-radius
    - `.forecast-detail-card`: expanded forecast card with full text
    - `.entity-graph-container svg`: responsive
    - `.entity-table`: monospace, zebra-striped
    - `.view-toggle`: button group for graph/table switch
  </action>

    `cd frontend && npx tsc --noEmit` passes.

  <done>
    CountryBriefPage opens as full-screen modal on 'country-selected' event.
    6 tabs: Overview (summary grid), Active Forecasts (expandable cards), GDELT Events (placeholder with mock layout), Forecast History (chart + list), Entity Relations (force graph + table toggle), Calibration (reliability diagram + Brier table).
    Overview tab provides synthesized at-a-glance view.
    Forecast cards dispatch 'forecast-selected' for ScenarioExplorer integration.
    Entity Relations has d3-force graph and structured table toggle.
