# Requirements Archive: v1.0 Explainable Geopolitical Forecasting Engine

**Archived:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** SHIPPED

This is the archived requirements specification for v1.0.
For current project state, see `.planning/PROJECT.md`.

## Requirements

### Core Requirements (All Shipped)

- [x] Event data ingestion from GDELT API with custom enrichment pipeline
  - **Outcome:** Phase 1 delivered GDELT client, EventStorage, run_pipeline.py

- [x] Temporal knowledge graph construction from event streams
  - **Outcome:** Phase 2 delivered TemporalKnowledgeGraph with add_events_batch()

- [x] Hybrid model ensemble combining TKG algorithms (RE-GCN/TiRGN) with LLM reasoning
  - **Outcome:** Phase 3 delivered EnsemblePredictor with 60/40 LLM/TKG weighting

- [x] Explainable reasoning chain generation for each prediction
  - **Outcome:** Phase 3 delivered ReasoningOrchestrator with LLM reasoning paths

- [x] Probability calibration system with Brier score optimization
  - **Outcome:** Phase 4 delivered IsotonicCalibrator and temperature scaling

- [x] Evaluation framework against historical events
  - **Outcome:** Phase 4 delivered historical evaluation with performance tracking

### Out of Scope (Maintained)

- Real-time processing — daily batch updates only, not 15-minute cycles
- Human crowdsourcing — pure AI system without human forecaster integration
- Multi-language support — English sources only for v1
- Financial market modeling — no cross-sector impact propagation
- Production deployment — research prototype focused on algorithm development
- User interface — API/CLI only, no web frontend
